My 55th assignment! We explored GraphQL and try out some queries and mutations.  

I created a basic query to fetch posts, then extended the query to include the id and userId of each one. After that, it wasn't a problem to filter them by that id.  

Second, I implemented mutations to create, edit and delete posts. 

I used react-bootstrap to make some decent forms, buttons, and the list of posts, and used modals to render the form within it as it's still my favorite way of doing so.
